<p>Discordjs bot to download and convert music videos.</p>

<br>
<br>

## About
Since yt-dlp and ffmpeg are both command-line based, this bot is supposed to help the usage of both programs along with the Discord GUI.

## Usage so far
    -ytdl [fileType] [url]

## Installation 
Just your regular DiscordJs bot, set-up a config.json properly with your application token and you are good to go.
    
## Main goals:
  * Mess around with ffmpeg and yt-dlp options  to give more detailed user inputs with ease
  * Mp3 to ogg conversion for the sake of the filesize  
  * File size focused video conversions while retaining decent quality
