<p>Discordjs bot to download and convert music videos using yt-dlp and ffmpeg.</p>

## About
Since yt-dlp and ffmpeg are both command-line based, this bot is supposed to help the usage of both programs along with the Discord GUI.

## Usage so far

## Installation 
Just your regular DiscordJs bot, set-up a config.json properly with your application token and you are good to go (remember to  have yt-dlp and ffmpeg on the PATH of your system)
    
## Main goals:
  * Mess around with ffmpeg and yt-dlp options  to give more detailed user inputs with ease
  * Mp3 to ogg conversion for the sake of the filesize  
  * File size focused video conversions while retaining decent quality
